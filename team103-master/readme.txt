Physical setup:
The boards need to be facing one another (the IR communicators pointing directly at each others' receiver) in order for the communication to work properly. For extra effects, wire up a buzzer to PIN 6, a red LED to PIN 5, and a green LED to PIN 4.

Program setup:
To make the program, type: 'make program' into the command line. Both programs need to be loaded onto the boards before anything else is done!

Gameplay:
1. To begin the game, each player will need to press the black joystick down.
2. The joystick can then be used to move the paddle around. Try to deflect the ball for as long as you can!
3. When a player loses a round, the ball will speed up slightly. The first player to lose five rounds loses and the other player wins.

Enjoy!
